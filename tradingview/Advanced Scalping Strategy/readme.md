Strategy Overview

This Advanced Scalping Strategy is built upon the High-Low Cloud Trend indicator and optimized for short-term trading. The strategy excels at capturing quick price movements after a significant trend has been established and price returns to test key levels. By combining volume analysis, momentum oscillators, and precise entry conditions, it aims to increase win rate while minimizing false signals.
Core Trading Concept
The foundation of this strategy lies in identifying Cloud Retest patterns - a powerful market behavior where price establishes a trend, breaks through a significant resistance/support zone, and then returns to test that zone before continuing in the trend direction. This pattern offers exceptional risk-reward opportunities because:

The price action confirms the underlying trend
Entry occurs at optimal price levels (support/resistance)
Stop losses can be placed tight, just beyond the retest level
The trend continuation provides substantial profit potential

Key Technical Components
High-Low Cloud Trend Bands
The strategy employs two dynamic bands that adapt to market volatility:

Main Band (Band): Represents major support/resistance based on the highest and lowest prices over the lookback period
Secondary Band (Band1): A more responsive band calculated from 1/4 of the lookback period that serves as the key retest level

When price is above both bands, the trend is bullish, and when below, bearish. These bands form a "cloud" area that acts as a dynamic support/resistance zone.
Cloud Retest Signal Definition
The strategy's primary entry signals occur when:
Bullish Retest:

Price has established position above the main band (Band)
Price retraces to touch or slightly penetrate the secondary band (Band1)
Price bounces off this level, confirmed by a bullish close
Occurs within the context of an uptrend

Bearish Retest:

Price has established position below the main band (Band)
Price retraces to touch or slightly penetrate the secondary band (Band1)
Price rejects from this level, confirmed by a bearish close
Occurs within the context of a downtrend

Advanced Signal Filters
To enhance signal quality, the strategy employs multiple filters:

Volume Filter:

Ensures trades are only taken when volume exceeds a specified threshold
Helps confirm the validity of the retest by requiring sufficient market participation
Adjustable via the volume threshold multiplier


RSI Filter:

Confirms momentum is aligned with the trading signal
For long trades, requires RSI below oversold level (buying opportunity)
For short trades, requires RSI above overbought level (selling opportunity)


MACD Filter:

Confirms overall trend direction and momentum
For long trades, requires MACD line above signal line
For short trades, requires MACD line below signal line


Trend Direction Filter:

Ensures trades are taken only in the direction of the overall trend
Determined by the relationship between price and band value



Risk Management Controls
The strategy incorporates sophisticated risk management features:

Dynamic ATR-Based Stop Loss:

Calculates stop loss levels based on Average True Range
Adapts to current market volatility
Customizable multiplier to adjust risk tolerance


ATR-Based Take Profit:

Sets profit targets based on current market volatility
Ensures risk-reward ratio is maintained via customizable multiplier


Daily Trade Limit:

Prevents overtrading during volatile periods
Helps maintain discipline in execution


Trend Alignment:

Option to only trade in the direction of the prevailing trend
Reduces the likelihood of trading against strong market forces

Cloud Visualization:

Color-coded cloud shows trend direction (aqua for bullish, orange for bearish)
Gradient fill between bands highlights the key retest zone


Trade Signals:

Prominent triangles mark cloud retest signals (primary entry points)
Smaller triangles indicate secondary signals (optional entry points)
Background highlighting during retest conditions


Diagnostic Information:

Real-time filter status display
Signal confirmation indicators
Daily trade count and status



Strategy Settings Customization
The strategy offers extensive customization options:

Signal Selection:

Option to focus exclusively on cloud retest signals
Additional mean reversion signals (price touching extreme bands)
Cloud crossover signals for trend change opportunities


Filter Adjustments:

Individual toggles for each filter type
Customizable thresholds and periods
Visual feedback on filter status


Risk Parameters:

Adjustable stop loss and take profit multipliers
Pyramiding options for position building
Daily trade limits to control exposure



Optimal Usage Guidelines
For best results with this strategy:

Timeframe Selection:

Primary: 1-5 minute charts for scalping
Secondary: 1-hour charts for swing trading opportunities


Market Selection:

Most effective in liquid markets with clear trending behavior
Works well with major forex pairs, highly traded stocks, and index futures
Consider market session times for highest liquidity


Parameter Optimization:

Adjust lookback period based on asset volatility (shorter for more volatile assets)
Fine-tune filter thresholds to balance signal quality with frequency
Calibrate risk management parameters to match account size and risk tolerance


Visual Confirmation:

Look for clean, well-defined cloud formations
Ensure volume spikes on the initial breakout
Confirm retest with proper price action (rejection from band)



Performance Expectations
When properly optimized, this cloud retest strategy can achieve:

Win rates of 60-70% in trending markets
Risk-reward ratios of 1:2 to 1:3
Reduced drawdowns compared to traditional breakout strategies
Better performance in directional markets vs ranging conditions

The strategy particularly excels during times of clear market direction and tends to generate fewer but higher-quality signals compared to other scalping approaches.
